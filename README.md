esProc SPL is a pure Java developed software that can serve as a programming language for data analysis, a middleware for report data preparation, and an efficient big data computing engine.

About esProc SPL
esProc SPL is a programming language. Unlike most text-based programming languages, SPL code is written in a grid similar to Excel, and just like Excel, you can see the execution results step by step in real-time. This reduces the learning curve for beginners and provides an excellent interactive experience:

SPL provides standard programming language features like branching, looping, and even recursion. Notably, SPL has powerful set operation capabilities, making the code more concise. For instance, the famous eight queens puzzle can be solved in just a few lines.

SPL stands for Structured Process Language, and its main goal is structured data computation. Currently, SQL is the mainstream language in this field, but SQL has many limitations and often requires external help, such as Python, to implement a full computational task. SPL introduces discreteness based on set operations for structured data tables, integrating the shared advantages of SQL and Java, allowing you to achieve the effect of SQL+Python using only SPL.
From this essay [The most powerful grouping operation in history, bar none](https://c.esproc.com/article/1739934617514), you can gain insight into one aspect of SPL's stronger language capabilities and understand why SPL can cover SQL+Python. With even more powerful features yet to be explored, SPL has the potential to revolutionize how complex data processing tasks are handled.
We are constantly collecting practical SQL problems and solving them in SPL here: https://c.esproc.com/tag/Application. Through these examples, you'll further appreciate SPL's elegance and powerful cappabilities.

esProc is developed entirely in Java, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into Java applications and deployed as part of them. SPL also offers robust multi-data source capabilities, supporting a variety of data sources, including RDBs, NoSQL, and more - possibly the most in the industry.

esProc can easily implement lightweight multi-data source hybrid computations, rather than relying on a heavy logical data warehouse, making it an ideal embedded computation engine for report queries and other application systems.
